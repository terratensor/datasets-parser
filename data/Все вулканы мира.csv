La Fossa cone, active throughout the Holocene and the location of most of the historical eruptions, occupies the 3-km-wide Caldera della Fossa at the  NW end of the elongated 3 x 7 km island. The Vulcanello lava platform forms a low, roughly circular peninsula on the northern tip of Vulcano that was formed as an island beginning in 183 BCE and was connected to Vulcano in about 1550 CE. Vulcanello is capped by three pyroclastic cones and was active intermittently until the 16th century.

Two styles of eruptive activity typically occur, sometimes simultaneously. Persistent explosive eruptions, sometimes with minor lava emissions, take place from one or more summit craters. Flank vents, typically with higher effusion rates, are less frequently active and originate from fissures that open progressively downward from near the summit (usually accompanied by Strombolian eruptions at the upper end). Cinder cones are commonly constructed over the vents of lower-flank lava flows.

Lava flows from cinder cones of the Tskhouk-Karckar volcano group overlie petroglyphs dated to the end of the 4th millennium and beginning of the 3rd millennium BCE and are themselves used in gravesites dated at 4720 +/- 140 yrs ago.

The 2-km-diameter island consists of a low, gently sloping surface of rhyolitic pumice from the caldera-forming eruption truncated by steep cliffs formed of underlying basaltic lava flows. The pre-caldera edifice consisted of two generations of shield volcanoes separated by a period of growth of a pyroclastic cone. Eruption of the voluminous Sandy Bay Tuff about 6300 years ago truncated the NW side of the Annexation shield volcano and formed a 12-km-wide, 1.1-km deep caldera during one of the largest eruptions identified in the SW Pacific. Following formation of the caldera and substantial marine erosion, a partly submarine and partly subaerial eruption centered about 2 km N of present-day Macauley Island produced basaltic scoriae and lava flows. A reported possible eruption from "Brimstone Island," 45 km W of Macauley at a location with a depth of about 2000 m and SW of Giggenbach submarine volcano, is likely a location error and could refer to an eruption from the submarine flank of Macauley caldera (Lloyd et al., 1996).</p></td></tr><tr height="6"><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="320" align="center"><tr align="center"><td width="33%"><a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=242021">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a></td></tr></table>;-178.475;-30.21;0

Ephemeral islands were formed during eruptions in 1920 and 1953, and the summit of the shallowest cone, Epi B, was at 34 m below sea level at the time of a 2001 survey.     </p></td></tr><tr height="6"><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="320" align="center"><tr align="center"><td width="33%"><a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=257060">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a></td></tr></table>;168.37;-16.68;0

The two cones are sometimes considered to be satellitic cones to Ichinsky, but Pevzner et al. (2000) noted petrological distinctions that suggest an independent origin. Unpublished radiocarbon ages revise those in Pevzner et al.

At least a dozen craters are located within an area of 3 km2, and bedded pyroclastic-surge deposits cover an area of 15 km2. Early scoria cone formation was followed by hydrovolcanic explosions that formed two clusters of explosion craters and tuff rings. Field work and revised dating (Calzia et al., 2016 Fierstein et al., 2016) based on paleomagnetic and 10Be evidence has shown that Ubehebe craters were formed during a single short-lived phreatic, phreatomagmatic, and magmatic eruptive episode about 2100 years ago.</p></td></tr><tr height="6"><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="320" align="center"><tr align="center"><td width="33%"><a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=323160">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a></td></tr></table>;-117.45;37.02;0

Growth of the modern Fuego volcano followed, continuing the southward migration of volcanism that began at the mostly andesitic Acatenango. Eruptions at Fuego have become more mafic with time, and most historical activity has produced basaltic rocks.

Ash clouds were reported from the summit crater in 1819, and an effusive eruption was inferred to have occurred from a N-flank fissure around the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. A low ice-free lava platform, Blackstone Plain, is located on the north coast, surrounding a group of former sea stacks. A cluster of parasitic cones on the SE flank, the Ashen Hills, appear to have been modified since 1820 (LeMasurier and Thomson, 1990). Analysis of satellite imagery available since 1989 (Gray et al., 2019 MODVOLC) suggests frequent eruptive activity (when weatehr conditions allow), volcanic clouds, steam plumes, and thermal anomalies indicative of a persistent, or at least frequently active, lava lake in the summit crater. Due to this observational bias, there has been a presumption when defining eruptive periods that activity has been ongoing unless there is no evidence for at least 10 months.</p></td></tr><tr height="6"><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="320" align="center"><tr align="center"><td width="33%"><a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=390090">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a></td></tr></table>;-26.483;-57.8;0

This field most likely represents a distal feature of the East Eifel Volcanic Field. The eruption of Rodderberg occurred in two phases. The first was phreatomagmatic, producing xenolith-rich, poorly sorted deposits. The second phase was dominated by Strombolian activity, resulting in xenolith-poor, thick and well-sorted coarse scoria deposits (Paulick et al., 2009). Geochemistry reveals the rocks erupted from the RVC to be leucitic nephelinite. The total erupted volume of material from the RVC eruption is estimated to be about 1.0x10^-2 km3 of magma and 2-3x10^-2 km3 of tephra - a rough order of magnitude estimate. The RVC deposits were previously dated at 26,000-27,000 years before present (IAVCEI 1973), but more recent thermoluminescence data placed the eruption at around 300 ka, during a glacial period in central Europe (Paulick et al., 2009).      </p></td></tr><tr height="6"><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="320" align="center"><tr align="center"><td width="33%"><a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=210813">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a></td></tr></table>;7.2;50.62;0

Other smaller volcanic systems are Morlupo, Vigna di Valle, Trevignano, and Baccano (Conticelli et al., 1997). The Sacrofano and  Bacciano centers dominate the five phases of the complex's eruptive history. The first two phases involved intense explosive activity at Sacrofano and Molupa (0.6-0.4 Ma), resulting in tuffs, ashes, and pyroclastic flows during the pre-Sacrofano Caldera stage. During the third phase, hydromagmatic eruptions formed the Sacrofano Caldera and minor lava flows occurred in the post-caldera stage. In the western sector, a stratovolcano and the Bracciano Caldera developed, along with fissure eruptions that produced flood lavas greater than 100 km3, air-fall tuffs, and surge deposits. Activity at small eruptive vents on the rims of the collapsed Bracciano and Sacrofano Calderas dominated the fourth phase, resulting in pyroclastics at Bracciano and parasitic cinder cones and lava flows at Sacrofano. Hyrdomagmatic activity localized between the two calderas, which produced tuff rings, cones, and maars, dominated the final phase (Conticelli et al., 1997).    </p></td></tr><tr height="6"><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="320" align="center"><tr align="center"><td width="33%"><a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=211809">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a></td></tr></table>;12.22;42.17;0

The most recent eruptions occurred on the cone forming Mount Galloway and Mount Waterhouse at the center of 4-km-wide main island. Marine erosion has exposed sections through tuff cones at Perpendicular Head and Albatross Point at the NE and SE tips of the island, respectively. Radiometric dates indicated basalts that are younger than 1 million years (250-500 ka with high uncertainty W of Reef Point), and Cullen (1969) also speculated that volcanism may have begun in the Tertiary and persisted "almost to the present day."</p></td></tr><tr height="6"><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="320" align="center"><tr align="center"><td width="33%"><a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=335010">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a></td></tr></table>;178.781;-49.684;0

The remaining edifice of Besar consists of about 50% of a crater rim completely open to the E, with three small domes or cones, the largest of which contains a small pond in a summit crater. The geothermal area was described by Neumann van Padang (1951) as including four small solfatara fields: Gemurah Badas (8 x 10 m with hot springs and sulfur gas exhalation), Gemurah Bubur (large basin of boiling water formed between 1930-40), Gemurah Keningan (boiling mud springs, very active 1938-40), and Gemurah Ilahan (2 km upstream of Badas with geyser-like mud springs and dead trees). A "phreatic steam eruption" in April 1940 was noted from Gemurah Ilahan. Hochstein and Sudarman (1993) considered the Marga Bayur geothermal system to be "associated with a degassing magma chamber because radiometric dating of the youngest tuff deposiuts (unpublished data, Pertamina files) showed that [the volcano had been] active during the last 30 kyr."

The basaltic region may be over 200 m thick in areas, localized around eruptive centers, but no deposits greater than 10 m have been observed. Some columnar jointing is present. K-Ar dating gave ages ranging from 0.44 Ma to 1.15 Ma for the oldest samples (Soeria-Atmadja et al., 1985 in Barber et al., 2005), but more recent ages measured from more well-preserved flows and spatter cones are around 0.01 to 0.8 million years. Sukadana is technically part of the back-arc region of the Sumatra Volcanic Arc Segment, evidenced by notable textural and compositional differences from the arc volcanics, as well as a similarity to the back-arc Bukit Telor basalts (Barber et al., 2005).</p></td></tr><tr height="6"><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="320" align="center"><tr align="center"><td width="33%"><a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=261822">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a></td></tr></table>;105.65;-5.25;0

The initial fissure eruptions produced trachybasaltic lava flows 15-17 km long that covered an area of 100 km2. The most recent eruptions were considered by the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Vlodavetz and Piip, 1959) to have occurred between about 1300 and 1700 CE from Aniusk (Monni) cone, based on morphological evidence. Later work (Ignatiev, 1994) showed that Monni volcano was partially destroyed by glaciers and phreatic explosions produced by glacial meltwater flowing into the vent. Lava flows from Maly Anyuy volcano flowed onto glacial ice, and explosions induced by glacial meltwater destroyed the cone. The Monni lava flows dammed up drainages, forming lakes.

At least two stages of volcanism are present, the first of which includes lava flows overlying the 20 m terrace of the Dgida, Darkhintuy, and Khammey rivers.  In the Darkhintuy valley the lava flows are overlain by gravels, which are in turn overlaid by lava flows from the Bartoy valley.  Earlier Pleistocene-to-Holocene estimates of the age of the Dgida Basin volcanism (summarized in Whitford Stark, 1987) were modified by later age-dating by Rasskazov et al.

The latest eruptions took place from the northern part of the horst about 220,000 years ago at Cerro Corero lava dome (also known as Cerro de la Charca), north of El Castillo.  The youngest feature of the La Yeguada complex is the Media Luna cinder cone, which was erupted through Tertiary ignimbrite deposits at the NW side of the complex.  The oldest peat layer within a small lake dammed by a basaltic lava flow originating from the cone was radiocarbon dated at about 300-350 years ago, but later dating has shown that flow was erupted about 45,000 years ago, and that the La Yeguada complex has not had Holocene eruptions.

A cone feature located immediately NE of the maar is the remains of a dacitic dome with landslides on the flanks. They determined that the volcanic features were all the result of a single monogenetic eruptive period that began with the vent opening and incremental growth of the original crater, followed by additional widening of the maar. Effusion of the dome was the last stage of active volcanism. A paleosol below the young maar sequence was C14 dated at 20,056 ± 93 years cal BP, and the dome was slightly younger at 18 ka BP based on fission track dating of apatite.</p></td></tr><tr height="6"><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="320" align="center"><tr align="center"><td width="33%"><a href="https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=351001">Smithsonian Volcano Information</a></td></tr></table>;-74.961;5.65;0
